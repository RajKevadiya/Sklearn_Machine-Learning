# Sklearn_Machine-Learning

This is the model I built during my datascience course in JupyterNotebook using Python.
If you will open an absenteeism_new_data.csv file, there you will find some data of the employees and the model is 
predicting the probability of being absent during a particular workday.
One can see the nice graph comparing probability with individual feature with Tableau using absenteeism_module.py file.
